Host System Requirements # Minimum 8 GB of RAM. A Dual Core Processor. 128 GB+ of Hard Drive Storage Step 1 # Create a Virtual Machine # Open VMware Workstation and Click on File and select New Virtual Machine, Select Custom (advanced) option and click Next. Keep the Default Hardware Compatibility Workstation 16.x and click Next Select I will install the operating system later. as we will be mounting the ISO seperately once the Virtual Machine has been created. Select Linux as the Guest Operating System and Version Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 64-bit. Give your Virtual Machine a Name and a Location. Select the Number of Available Cores per processor depending on your Host systems availability. In this case we have selected 02 Cores. Specify the Amount of RAM as per your requirement. In this Case we had 16 GB of Avilable Memory on host, Hence we have selected 8 GB. Select Use bridged networking as we will be using the external LAN for our Networking. Keep the default selection LSI Logic. Keep the default selection for virtual disk type SCSI. Selelct Create a new virtal disk. Allocate a disk size of 64 GB and select Store virtual disk as a single file and complete the wizard. Once the Virtual machine has been created, Edit the virtual machine settings Under the Hardware tab, select the Virtual Disk Drive and locate the RHEL ISO for the Installation. Under the Options tab, select the Advance and under Firware Type select UEFI and click ok. Now Power on the Virtual Machine\nStep 2 # Install RHEL 7.9 # Select English as the Language and click on Continue. Select Software Selection and under Base Environment select Minimal Install.
